# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the track management system to speaker associations and updates the clip creation process to use speaker-based track selection. The system will allow tracks to have multiple speakers and use this information to intelligently select the appropriate video track when creating clips based on transcript segments.

## Glossary

- **Track_Entity**: Video track record in DynamoDB containing speaker associations
- **Speaker_Array**: List of speaker names associated with a track
- **Clip_Creation_Tool**: AI tool that creates clip recommendations with speaker requirements
- **Track_Selection_Algorithm**: Logic that matches speakers to tracks for clip processing
- **Track_Update_Endpoint**: API endpoint for modifying track metadata including speakers
- **Speaker_Matching**: Process of finding tracks that contain a specific speaker

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to associate speakers with video tracks during upload, so that the system can automatically select the correct track when creating clips.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a track upload, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL accept an optional speakers array parameter
2. WHEN updating a track, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL allow modification of the speakers array
3. WHEN storing track metadata, THE Track_Entity SHALL include a speakers field containing an array of speaker names
4. WHEN validating speakers input, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL ensure speakers are non-empty strings
5. WHILE processing track data, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL normalize speaker names by trimming whitespace

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to update track speaker information after upload, so that I can correct or add speaker associations as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a track update request is received, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL validate the track exists for the episode
2. WHEN updating speakers, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL replace the existing speakers array completely
3. WHEN speakers array is provided, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL validate each speaker name is a non-empty string
4. WHEN speakers array is empty or null, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL set the speakers field to an empty array
5. WHILE updating track metadata, THE Track_Update_Endpoint SHALL preserve all other track properties

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to specify required speakers when creating clips, so that the system can select the appropriate video track for processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating clip segments, THE Clip_Creation_Tool SHALL require a speaker field for each segment
2. WHEN validating clip input, THE Clip_Creation_Tool SHALL ensure speaker field is a non-empty string
3. WHEN processing clip segments, THE Clip_Creation_Tool SHALL remove the text property requirement
4. WHEN validating segments, THE Clip_Creation_Tool SHALL require both startTime and endTime properties
5. WHILE creating clips, THE Clip_Creation_Tool SHALL store speaker information in the clip record

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the clip processing system to automatically select tracks based on speakers, so that clips are extracted from the correct video source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a clip segment, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL query all tracks for the episode
2. WHEN multiple tracks contain the required speaker, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL use the first matching track
3. WHEN no track contains the required speaker, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL log a warning and skip the segment
4. WHEN a matching track is found, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL use that track for segment extraction
5. WHILE processing multiple segments, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL evaluate each segment independently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for speaker-track matching, so that I can troubleshoot issues with clip processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no tracks exist for an episode, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL log an error and fail gracefully
2. WHEN speaker matching fails, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL log the speaker name and available tracks
3. WHEN track data is malformed, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN processing succeeds, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL log the selected track for each segment
5. WHILE handling errors, THE Track_Selection_Algorithm SHALL continue processing remaining segments
