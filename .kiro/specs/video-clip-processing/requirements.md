# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated video clip processing workflow that extracts video segments from chunked video tracks based on AI-detected clip recommendations. The system uses AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the process of segment extraction, video processing with FFmpeg, and final clip assembly.

## Glossary

- **Video_Clip_Processor**: The Step Functions workflow that orchestrates clip processing
- **Segment_Extractor**: Lambda function that extracts video segments using FFmpeg
- **Clip_Stitcher**: Lambda function that combines segments into final clips
- **Clip_Record**: DynamoDB entity storing processed clip metadata
- **Video_Chunk**: Pre-processed 2-minute video segments stored in S3
- **Clip_Recommendation**: AI-generated suggestion for potential clips with timestamps
- **Segment_Timestamp**: Start and end time boundaries for clip extraction

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically process AI-detected clips into video files, so that I can review and use them for social media distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a clip recommendation exists for an episode, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL initiate processing for each recommended clip
2. WHEN processing a clip, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL iterate through each segment within the clip timestamp boundaries
3. WHEN a segment is identified, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL extract the corresponding video frames from the appropriate video chunks
4. WHEN all segments are extracted, THE Clip_Stitcher SHALL combine segments into a single MP4 file
5. WHEN clip processing completes, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL create a Clip_Record in DynamoDB with processing metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the clip processing workflow to handle video chunk mapping accurately, so that segments are extracted from the correct source chunks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining source chunks for a segment, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL calculate which 2-minute chunks contain the segment timestamps
2. WHEN a segment spans multiple chunks, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL extract portions from each relevant chunk
3. WHEN extracting from chunks, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL apply precise timestamp offsets to maintain accuracy
4. WHEN chunk boundaries are encountered, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL handle seamless transitions between chunks
5. IF a required chunk is missing, THEN THE Segment_Extractor SHALL log an error and fail the segment processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want processed clips to be stored in an organized S3 structure, so that I can easily locate and manage my video assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting segments, THE Segment_Extractor SHALL store each segment at `{episodeId}/clips/{clipId}/segments/{index}.mp4`
2. WHEN stitching segments, THE Clip_Stitcher SHALL store the final clip at `{episodeId}/clips/{clipId}/clip.mp4`
3. WHEN storing files, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL ensure sequential segment indexing starting from 0
4. WHEN processing completes, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL clean up intermediate segment files
5. WHILE processing, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL maintain organized directory structure for each clip

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the clip processing workflow to be resilient and observable, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fails at any step, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL retry the failed operation up to 3 times
2. WHEN retries are exhausted, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL mark the clip processing as failed in DynamoDB
3. WHILE processing, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL log detailed progress information for each step
4. WHEN processing completes, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL record processing duration and file sizes
5. IF FFmpeg operations fail, THEN THE Segment_Extractor SHALL capture and log detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to process multiple clips concurrently, so that I can get results faster for episodes with many detected clips.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clips exist for an episode, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL process up to 5 clips concurrently
2. WHEN processing clips concurrently, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL ensure each clip uses isolated S3 paths
3. WHEN concurrent processing occurs, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL manage Lambda concurrency limits appropriately
4. WHEN a clip fails processing, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL continue processing remaining clips
5. WHILE processing multiple clips, THE Video_Clip_Processor SHALL track overall progress and completion status
